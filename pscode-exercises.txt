// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
start
declare a=9
declare b=5
declare sum=a+b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
declare d=8
IF d/2 print Even
Else print odd
END IF

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

start
// SET ARRAY OF 5 ELEMENTS
int x[5]={40,70,20,33,66};
// READ FIRST ELEMENT
READ[0]
// read the second element
READ[1]

READ[2]
READ[3]
READ[4]

//Calculate the average 
declare sum=[0]+[1]+[2]+[3]+[4]
declare average=sum/5
print "the average is"=average

//the smallest (minimum) Numbers
small=x[0]
int i
for(i=1,i<5,i++) 
  if x[i]<small 
    then x[i]=small
    print "the smallest number is "=small


 //largest (maximum) of the five numbers.
max=x[0]
int i
for(i=1,i<5,i++) 
  if x[i]>max
    then x[i]=max
    print "the maximum number is "=max
